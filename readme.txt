This is a collection of resources for picaxe08m2 based nodes that
collector sensor data and transmit it to a picaxe/pi collector system.

Collector.bas should be deployed on the picaxe part of the collector
system, see documentation and circuit diagrams.

The rest should be used as a template for building your own sensors.
